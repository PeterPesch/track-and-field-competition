# Demo Number of Athletes

The first work-around that I needed was some tool to quickly see the number of athletes for each Field event, or the number of athletes for each Track Event.
I can use those numbers to make an educated guess of the time needed for that scheduled event.

To count the number of athletes, I would need to access either the startlist page or the results page (if they exist).

As my main purpose is estimation, I decided to implement the Startlist object (in the new startlist subpackage). Resulting counts should somehow be available in the schedule Item object (that is the Item object in the Schedule subpackage).
